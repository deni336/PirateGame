# Treasure Hunt Game - Deep Q-Learning Agent

## Project Overview

The Treasure Hunt Game is a reinforcement learning project where an intelligent agent (the pirate) learns to navigate a maze and find the treasure before being caught. This project applies deep Q-learning to optimize the pirate's path toward the goal.

### Code Contributions

### Provided Code:

- TreasureMaze.py: Defines the maze environment as an 8x8 matrix.

- GameExperience.py: Stores game states (episodes) for training the reinforcement learning model.

- A Jupyter Notebook with a structured workflow for training the agent.

### My Contributions:

- Implemented the deep Q-learning algorithm in the provided notebook.

- Designed the reward system to improve learning efficiency.

- Tuned hyperparameters such as learning rate, discount factor, and exploration-exploitation balance.

- Optimized the training process using an experience replay buffer.

- Visualized the agentâ€™s learning process and performance over multiple episodes.

## Connection to Computer Science Concepts

### What Do Computer Scientists Do, and Why Does It Matter?

Computer scientists solve real-world problems by designing intelligent systems, developing efficient algorithms, and implementing machine learning models. Reinforcement learning, as applied in this project, is crucial for advancements in robotics, game AI, autonomous navigation, and decision-making systems.

### How Do I Approach a Problem as a Computer Scientist?

- Understand the Problem: Define the environment, constraints, and expected agent behavior.

- Select the Right Algorithm: Chose deep Q-learning to allow the agent to learn from experience.

- Iterative Development: Trained the model, analyzed results, and refined hyperparameters.

- Optimize for Performance: Used experience replay to improve sample efficiency.

- Test and Evaluate: Ensured the agent performed well across different runs.

### Ethical Responsibilities to the End User and Organization

- Transparency & Explainability: AI decisions should be interpretable, avoiding black-box models where possible.

- Bias & Fairness: Reinforcement learning models must not develop biases that lead to unfair outcomes.

- Security & Privacy: Data used for training should be handled responsibly to prevent misuse.

- Reliability & Safety: The agent should behave predictably and avoid unintended consequences in real-world applications.
